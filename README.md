# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Project Features:

1. anyone can easily route every pages by clicking menu item.

2. this is a Single Page Application , that's why it provides a smoother and more responsive user experience because they load content dynamically without requiring full page reloads. This results in faster transitions between pages and a more app-like feel.

3. SPAs typically load data from the server only once, and subsequent interactions with the application fetch data through API calls. This reduces the load on the server compared to traditional multi-page applications.
